* peek(1)
  peek into your shell pipelines
** What is this?
   essentially it's the same thing as ~tee /dev/stderr~
** Ok, if it's the same as ~tee~ into stderr, why did you make this?
   I needed visibility into my shell pipelines and I wanted to see how much slower go's std library
   was for the task. It turns out that for small inputs it's marginally slower and for large inputs
   it's way faster (2x the throughput on very large files, see [[file:Benchmarking.org::*Benchmarking][Benchmarking]])
** Installation
   ~go get github.com/chrispickard/peek~
** Usage
   - Insert into a shell pipeline, ~peek~ will print stdin to stderr and pass it through to stdout
